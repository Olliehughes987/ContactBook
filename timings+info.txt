I have listed the rough timings below, as these were not timed I am only
estimating.
I have tried to lay them out in the rough order they were completed in.


mock contact with styling -> 20 mins
populating with mock contacts -> 40 mins
fetching data from API -> 10mins with research
dynamically making contacts using API data -> 1 hour with research
styling search and sort boxes -> 10 mins
creating function/s for search -> 1.5 hours with research
creating function/s for sort -> 1 hour with research
populating panel (contact pop out) -> 1 hour
finishing styling -> 30 mins


I could have finished a few elements of the task quicker, however I ran into
a few problems which took some time to solve.
I am proud with how this project turned out and I hope you are too :)
